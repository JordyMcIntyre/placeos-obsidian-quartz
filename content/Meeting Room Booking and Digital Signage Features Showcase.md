Book, cancel and control your meeting rooms using simple prompts.

Interactions are changing from:

point and click - where users input information on a device  
to:

describe and done - where you simply state your needs

In partnership with AOPEN APAC we'll be showcasing our latest meeting room and digital signage features. Join the demonstration, ask questions and see what's possible.
