The latest release of ChatGPT 4o has the internet alight.

But what does this mean for the building industry?

Jon & Steve will be going live to discuss:

→ how this will change existing workflows  
→ what new workflows and experiences will arise  
→ how GPT will handle multimodal and APIs

It's early days but we're excited by all of this and want your input!
