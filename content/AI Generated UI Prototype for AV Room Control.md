**We built an AV control prototype in one phone call**

A few years ago, building a front-end interface meant weeks of wireframing, prototyping, and dev work. Not anymore.

In one call we built a room control interface‚Äîincluding AV controls, booking, catering, and location services, here's how we did it.

**Step 1: Start with a clear prompt**

The key to getting a good result is writing a good prompt. To write a good prompt, use an LLM. We're using ChatGPT to help us prompt for Bolt.

Here‚Äôs the initial prompt:

"Build a new room control interface that includes: AV control for two displays, a sound system, source audio, and two wireless mics. Show room booking info (next booking, daily timeline), a catering tab, and a floor plan with available rooms highlighted."

**Step 2: Copy & Paste**

Bolt instantly generated:

‚Üí A tab-based UI with AV controls  
‚Üí A booking system displaying meeting info  
‚Üí A catering tab for placing orders  
‚Üí A floor plan for viewing room availability

The first draft isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs a strong starting point.

**Step 3: Make improvements using AI‚Äìdriven edits**

‚Üí The design was too plain  
‚Üí The naming conventions weren‚Äôt clear

Instead of going into the CSS or JSON files, we simply prompted:

‚Üí "Make the interface more visually bold with stronger color selections."  
‚Üí "Fix the wireless mic controls so they are independent of the display audio."

Each request was instantly applied.

**Step 4: Connect to real-world data with APIs**

To make it functional, we needed to connect it to real-world building data using APIs. Our APIs provide access to functions like:

‚Üí Room status updates via real-time location tracking  
‚Üí Catering requests linked to an ordering system

**What this means for UI design?**

Now, a domain expert (not a developer) can build an interface in minutes.

IT teams can rapidly prototype solutions.

Product managers can validate ideas in real-time.

**The Future of UI is Prompt-Based.**

**How PlaceOS Makes This Possible**

PlaceOS is an integration platform. It sits between systems, devices, and software, making it possible to build custom solutions on top of a shared foundation.

Instead of a static SaaS tool, it‚Äôs a flexible architecture where you can:

‚Üí Build a custom frontend on top of standardized APIs  
‚Üí Add new features in parallel without disrupting existing ones  
‚Üí Evolve your workplace tools over time instead of replacing them

If you could build any interface using AI, what would you create?
