This partnership brings more reach and capabilities to the PlaceOS ecosystem.

Nice work everyone involved in the technical enablement and initial projects.

Our customers can now work with a leading global product development agency to make sure their exact and unique requirements are met.

PlaceOS will connect to everything—Monstarlabs will create the UX on top.  
This enables true smart places.

Launched in Cannes—wish I was there!
