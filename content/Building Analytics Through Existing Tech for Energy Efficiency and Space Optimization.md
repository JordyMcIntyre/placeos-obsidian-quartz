You'd be surprised how often data goes uncollected in buildings.

By simply integrating with existing technology, we bring that piece of technology or software into the fold.

That means it's now available to be used for analytics and as an input to trigger actions or to be controlled.

The easiest example is location data from wifi.

Every building has it. Just by integrating can triangulate users location who are connected to the network.

Then you can trigger actions based on location:

*   Low occupancy across the whole building? Push people to one section, shutdown everything else = energy reduction & improved space utilization.
*   Too many people on one floor? Prompt people to shift locations by assigning new bookings to other locations.

This kind of approach increases the value of built assets.

*   value for the tenant (better space to be in)
*   value of the building (cheaper to run)
*   sustainability metrics (more energy efficient)
