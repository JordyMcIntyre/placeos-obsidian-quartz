What's the point of taking the light switch off your wall and putting it into an app...  
  
AND making it so the app doesn't work with anything else ü´†

This is analogous to a lot of solutions in the built environment.

When I started with Steve, it was 5 touch panels in a room, each controlling lighting, aircon, av etc.

The same problem exists now but those touch panels are siloed apps for meeting rooms, av, desks, visitors, access control... The list goes on.

The question we always ask is, why have the switch at all?

Remove the interface entirely and activate automatically based on other data sources. When you connect multiple data points, you can define what happens in a space without having to press a button or use an app.

This is one of our core philosophies of PlaceOS.

So I'm curious, what's the most useless interface you've used?
