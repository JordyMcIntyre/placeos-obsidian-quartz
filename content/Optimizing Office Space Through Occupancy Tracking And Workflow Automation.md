Some things are common sense but not common practice.

**For example...**

Office buildings using 100% of their space while only a fraction of their staff are in.

If 30% of your people are in, condense the available space to 30%.

The effects are twofold:

**1. It saves energy (cost)  
2. It creates energy (vibe)**

In order to achieve this, you need to understand occupancy and utilize workflow automation.

Occupancy tracking through integrations like:

*   active directory
*   calendars
*   sensors
*   access control
*   wifi & network

And then automate:

*   space availability
*   hvac
*   lighting
