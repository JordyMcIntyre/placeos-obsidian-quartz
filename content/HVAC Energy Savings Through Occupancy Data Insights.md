If running your HVAC was 40% of your energy bill, you'd want to know if it was running in empty rooms.

The easiest way to identify where that's happening and how to fix it is context.

The recipe is simple:

- Compare occupancy data with HVAC use, identify anomalies and address.

If you'd like to see this in action, I'll be joining Disha Moses for a webinar on this exact topic for university campuses.

I'll also be walking through AV control & campus experience.

It's on tomorrow, all the details are here: [https://lnkd.in/gCMAvYFw](https://lnkd.in/gCMAvYFw)
