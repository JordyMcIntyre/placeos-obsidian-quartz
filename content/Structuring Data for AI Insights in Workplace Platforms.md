Imagine you have 30 different spreadsheets.

Now imagine that each one has its own  
→ structure  
→ naming conventions  
→ format

Now imagine you're asked to extract learnings and insights out of them...

You'd struggle.

And so does AI.

First you need to structure and normalize data.

For example, at PlaceOS, we handle data by streamlining its structure for efficient storage in a specialized type of database. Each piece of data is assigned a unique identifier which helps in organizing and retrieving it easily. When needed, our software can convert these identifiers back into common, understandable terms.

For developers working on our platform, there are two main ways to use the data:

**1. For creating user interfaces,** we provide support for various data types and structures that are automatically managed by our system.

**2. For data analysis,** developers can give specific instructions on how to interpret more complex data, helping the analytics tools understand it better.

Essentially, while all data is stored in a uniform way, understanding and using it effectively requires knowing the context of the data.

We make this easier by standardizing how we handle different types of data (like sensors and bookings) so that the same methods and queries can be used across different clients and applications.
