Knowing how many people come into the office each day isn't enough data to make an informed decision about what to do with your office space.

Surveys alone won‚Äôt cut it.  
Utilization metrics alone won‚Äôt cut it.

You need a combination of data to get a complete picture.

Not all occupancy data is created equal, but they‚Äôre all equally important. Here's how you can get it:

**‚ñ∏ Access Control:** Badge swipes counts, giving you a daily occupancy count. However, it doesn‚Äôt provide granular details like space utilization, what spaces people are using, etc. ‚Äî just that they entered the building.

**‚ñ∏ WIFI:** This tracks devices across the network, pinpointing locations within about a 6ft radius. It provides real-time occupancy data, allowing you to track metrics like utilization across all spaces. Every building has a WiFi network, so no additional hardware is needed, making this a great starting point.

**‚ñ∏ Camera Tracking:** Most buildings have security cameras and webcams in meeting rooms, it's another way to track occupancy.

**‚ñ∏ Sensors:** Usually reserved for desks and rooms. The downside is being an upfront cost having to roll them out across every desk and room. The upside is accuracy.

**‚ñ∏ Calendar Data:** Booking data to cross-reference with real-time location services. Understand who is booking spaces by team or department.

The challenge is normalizing all this data so it‚Äôs understandable and analyzable.

Now that you have the 'what', next you need the 'why'. That‚Äôs where survey data comes in, providing feedback from the people who use or avoid the space. Maybe that corner of the office is always cold, so people stay away.

Once you understand how and why people use the workplace, it‚Äôs about being dynamic.

One way to be dynamic is by using a recent innovation: running general power over Ethernet. First, it was network data, then lighting, and now general power. Anywhere there‚Äôs an Ethernet cable, there‚Äôs power. This means you can change the floor plan day-to-day based on the building's events.

**So in recap:**

◊Ç‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ Reliable, consistent data from multiple sources!  
◊Ç‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ Add context  
◊Ç‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ Be flexible and dynamic
