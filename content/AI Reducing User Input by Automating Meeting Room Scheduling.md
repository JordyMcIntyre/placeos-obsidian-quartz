Apps require input.

And all input equals error.

Which means, every time the user has to input something or interact with an interface, treat that as an error and see if we can remove it.

The less input the better.

With the introduction of AI, we're able to get much closer to that goal and remove types of input/interactions and change it to simple requests.

For example,  
  
1. Filling out meeting details  
2. Adding attendees  
3. Choosing the right location

Becomes,  
  
"I need a room next Tuesday for me and my team."

AI is able to pull all the relevant information and take action on your behalf.

But there's only one way this becomes possible.

Integration with relevant and normalized data and robust APIs.
