💡 Sales and product misalignment can destroy deals. I once saw a salesperson literally storm out of a meeting in frustration.

At my last professional job before launching my business career, I worked at a university medical faculty. One day, the Dean saw me walking past the boardroom and pulled me into a sales meeting for a software product he was considering. He wanted my input to help him make the buying decision.

Halfway through the pitch, he cut in:  
"Skip the slides—I’ve seen all that before. I just need it to do this…"

Then, something I’ll never forget happened. The salesperson threw his notebook in the air, yanked his laptop out of the HDMI cable, and stormed out. “I can’t do this anymore.”

At the time, it seemed like he was just frustrated with the meeting. But looking back, it’s clear he was stuck. He hadn’t closed the deal yet, and the customer was asking for things the software didn’t do—but he had nowhere to take that feedback. He could only sell what was in front of him.

On an individual level, he lost his cool when he shouldn’t have. It was a new faculty, so his sales lead time couldn’t have been more than six months.   
(Talk to me when you’ve spent two years working a deal—I can think of two of my own that took that long).

At PlaceOS, we take a different approach. If a request has real value—especially one that could scale—we explore it. Instead of shutting down, we’d mock up a solution, maybe in Figma, and ask: **“Is this what you had in mind?”**  
You don’t have to say yes to every feature request, but ignoring a clear, scalable idea from an executive buyer? That’s a serious business problem.

I realise that my experience as a buyer (many years ago!) has shaped—sometimes without me even realizing it—how I sell today.

❓ Ultimately, this raises an important question: **How far from your core offering do you go in a sales meeting? And how do you win a deal today based on the features you’ll deliver tomorrow?**
