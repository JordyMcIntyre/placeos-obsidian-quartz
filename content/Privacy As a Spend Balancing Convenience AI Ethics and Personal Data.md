I've been thinking about this concept, "privacy as a spend".

Where do we draw the line? This trade-off presents a choice: how much personal information are we willing to give up for convenience or experience?

Your location = being able to get places  
Your interests and activities = tailored entertainment & social interactions

It starts to get more complicated when you introduce AI and computer vision. Something being able to know so much about you can be dangerous. But also the more tailored that experience can become.

It's a double-edged sword and it all comes down to intention.

For example, Boeing rolling out sensors to "track occupancy" doesn't seem like a good way to spend the privacy of their employees.

Also, what's the outcome? Just knowing where someone is doesn't tell you much and it doesn't help their employees do their jobs. It's a lose-lose.

In conclusion, solid guard rails are needed in order to protect people. Balancing privacy with the need for enhanced features requires not just technological solutions but also a strong ethics and clear awareness.

**What are you spending your privacy on?**
