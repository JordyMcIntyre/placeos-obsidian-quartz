Most workplace management tools struggle at scale.

They rely on proprietary hardware, creating vendor lock-ins and limiting flexibility.

Scaling across diverse buildings shouldn‚Äôt mean sacrificing configurability or user experience.

Here‚Äôs how WorkMate standardizes operations while allowing local flexibility:

**Global Controls** ‚Äì Standardize settings across all locations.

**Regional Controls** ‚Äì Apply policies to groups of buildings with flexibility.

**Building-Level Customization** ‚Äì Tailor individual locations while maintaining broader standards.

**Time Zone & Location Control** ‚Äì Automatically adjust to a user's geolocation to interact with the right building.

**Workplace Services** ‚Äì Enable/disable features (desks, rooms, parking) per region or site.

**Auto-Release & No-Show Cancellation** ‚Äì Free up space dynamically at all levels.

**Parking & Facility Management** ‚Äì Set location-specific rules to avoid congestion.

**Visitor & Contractor Access** ‚Äì Enforce security protocols per site or region.

And this is just to name a few.

With hundreds of hot-swappable integrations, WorkMate ensures you can change systems without disrupting the user experience.
