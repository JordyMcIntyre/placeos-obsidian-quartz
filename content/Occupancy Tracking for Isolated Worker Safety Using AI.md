If you're the only person at work.

What happens if something goes wrong?

Well, it all comes down to occupancy tracking.

Typically, with occupancy, you want to know:

‚Üí How many people are in the space  
‚Üí What they're doing there

For isolated workers in manufacturing jobs, we already know the answer to how many...

It's 1.

Then it's about the what which translates to safety.

But how do you check?

Some places require the workers to check in every hour.

That still comes with a lot of risk.

Which is where occupancy can help.

Simply tracking their movement and if they don't move for X amount of time, send an alert.

Even more accurate than that, use computer vision with AI to track safety and if something goes wrong, trigger the alert.
