This is Mario. The Head of Solution Design at PlaceOS.

Recently, he's been using our own platform to automate the boiler and lighting in his apartment based on occupancy data.

Aside from being an awesome side project (and saving money on the energy bill). It's a great example of how the platform approach can adapt to any environment, whether that's a large scale commercial building or a single apartment.

And don't worry, the landlord is on board with it all.  
So much so that they want to keep using the platform after he moves out.

We had a great chat about energy, you can listen to the full conversation here: [https://lnkd.in/giYKNYz3](https://lnkd.in/giYKNYz3)
