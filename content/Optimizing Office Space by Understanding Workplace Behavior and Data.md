Why? It's the hardest question to answer when it comes to understanding your office.

Why do you need an office?  
Why do people come into the office?  
Why don‚Äôt they?  
Why is this one area always empty while a similar space is so popular?

One example I think holds some insight:

Feedback from one person, they go into the office because they need somewhere to spread out all their paper over a big desk. They can‚Äôt really do that at home on the dining room table‚Äîit‚Äôs just not practical.

Yes, it‚Äôs unique, and not every person/business will have this need. But that‚Äôs my point, there's no single way to solve the problem of commercial buildings and current occupancy levels.

What‚Äôs difficult, though, is that so many factors play into the why:

‚ñ∏ Workplace culture within teams, within organizations  
‚ñ∏ Culture between geo locations  
‚ñ∏ Individual preferences, team preferences, organization preferences  
‚ñ∏ The types of business  
‚ñ∏ Collaboration  
‚ñ∏ Colleagues  
‚ñ∏ Work events  
‚ñ∏ Client meetings  
‚ñ∏ Comfort  
‚ñ∏ Facilities  
‚ñ∏ Vibe

So, how do you figure it out?

Well, here's what a client of ours did:

They connected everything and then, for six weeks, did nothing...except collect data, of course.

After that time, they had data on occupancy, comfort, experience, and energy consumption. They were able to make decisions about their office and implement workflows that improved efficiency and experience.

For example:

‚Üí Occupancy is low in one space  
+ survey feedback reporting too warm  
+ temperatures are running a little hotter than normal  
= People are finding it too warm, let‚Äôs adjust HVAC to a more comfortable level.

‚Üí Occupancy is low in a certain space  
+ energy consumption is high  
= Why is that? Is it an efficiency issue or a fault?  
What data are we missing in order to figure this out?  
‚Üí Set up a notification alert on all rooms with high energy use & low occupancy for facilities teams to investigate.

All of this leads to more understanding about the why, because they have data **AND** context.

Then, you need to be dynamic and control things in real-time to improve experience and efficiency. More on this in the coming videos.
