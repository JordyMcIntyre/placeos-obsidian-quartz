Workplace flexibility isn‚Äôt about booking systems.

It‚Äôs about giving teams the freedom to shape their space to fit how they actually work.

That‚Äôs why neighborhoods are so effective‚Äîthey replace rigid structures with adaptable environments that evolve with team needs.

One of our clients saw this firsthand with people preferring large configurable spaces to run workshops, town halls and collaborative events.

Teams blocked out entire neighborhoods rather than booking traditional conference rooms.

Google‚Äôs latest offices take this even further‚Äîmodular spaces that shift in real time to support dynamic work.

The future of work isn‚Äôt fixed. It‚Äôs fluid.

How is your workplace handling the demand for larger, more adaptable spaces?
