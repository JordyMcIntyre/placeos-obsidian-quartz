Would you push straight to production without testing? Developers don‚Äôt (except for the intern maybe). Instead, they commit to a test environment first. Do the same for your workspace or campus.

We simulated a reduction in HVAC use for a lecture room:

‚Üí Current bookings: 6 hours  
‚Üí Current HVAC use: 14 hours  
‚Üí Predicted HVAC use: 7 hours

That's a 7 hour reduction.

For for anyone who's seen a campus energy bill, that makes a difference.

**But why simulate first?**

Because no system runs in isolation and we can't predict the future. You can make educated assumptions though and account for things like:

‚Üí Ramp-up time: How long does it take to heat or cool a space?  
‚Üí Occupancy without booking: Should you limit access for unbooked use?  
‚Üí Last-minute bookings: Do you restrict how late you can make a booking to account for ramp-up time?

Testing first ensures you don‚Äôt disrupt operations to figure these things out. Then, push to production when you know it works.

**Would you trust automation without a test run?**
