AI isn't good at everything.

And adding AI to a solution doesn't always make it better either.

What we've found AI is best at is:

**Human Interaction**

This is where the AI sits between the user and the technology or software and performs tasks on the user's behalf with parameters surrounding the type of tasks and functions it can perform ie you tell the AI, "book me a room for tomorrow".

It then goes off and does a bunch of API calls and functions to achieve the desired outcome.

In this scenario, it's quite a complex task that isn't too well defined. Something that was previously not possible without a very complex set of conditions, triggers and actions. It's just way easier to use a booking form to achieve the same outcome.

LLM's are amazing tools that are changing the way we approach UX design.

It's something we're discussing a lot at PlaceOS.

So we've decided to start recording those conversations.
