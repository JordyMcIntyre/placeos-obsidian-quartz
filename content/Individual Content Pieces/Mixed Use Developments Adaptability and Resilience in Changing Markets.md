**What makes mixed-use developments resilient?**

**→ Adaptability & flexibility**

This resilience can be attributed to the diverse functionality and adaptability of mixed-use spaces, which cater to both residential and commercial needs, thereby reducing dependency on a single economic sector.

The trend of mixed-use development remained steady even during economic downturns and the COVID-19 pandemic.

This multifunctional nature allows for the efficient utilization of space and resources, and it enables buildings to easily adapt to changing community needs and market demands. The integration of various uses also fosters a sense of community and enhances the vibrancy of the area.
