The most common missing factor in office utilization...

**Context.**

It's great capturing all this data on how much a space is being used, but that's only an indicator that something needs to be addressed. It doesn't explain why it's happening.

Ultimately, you need **PEOPLE** to understand why.

And how do you understand some of the reasons on why they might not like, or **LOVE**, a particular room?

By asking them.

With PlaceOS, we make it easy to collect context by capturing people's feedback in the right place at the right time.
