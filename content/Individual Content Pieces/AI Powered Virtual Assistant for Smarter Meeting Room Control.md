Ever turned up to your meeting and the one before you is still going?

That, and it's looking like it won't finish anytime soon.

No more!

Now, the AI can do the dirty work for you and boot them out üòÖ

We say this in jest, but we do like the idea of a virtual assistant that has the ability to control every aspect of the meeting room.

Where the:  
  
‚Üí LLM becomes the brain.  
‚Üí Touch panels become the eyes and ears.

This uplifts the touch panel, making it much more dynamic than simply showing how long you've got left or the ability to join a call or turn the tv off.

You're no longer limited to what functions they decided to show on the front end.

Every possible action is at your disposal.

...And all you need to do is ask.

This is what we love most about LLMs.

If you've set up the right foundation and integrated to everything.

The full list of functions each device, system or software has is now available to you.

You ask, the AI figures it out.
