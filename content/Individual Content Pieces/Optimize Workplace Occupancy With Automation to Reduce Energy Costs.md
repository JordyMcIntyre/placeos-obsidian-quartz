This needs to change.

30% of your workforce using 100% of your building.

Put 30% of your workforce into 30% of your building.

This one action will save your energy bill.

It seems simple but there are two key ingredients you need in order to make it work.

**1. Occupancy**  
**2. Automation**

Basically, you turn off what you're not using.

But it needs to be done dynamically by defining the conditions then automating the actions. As your workplace occupancy fluctuates, the technology and systems adjust accordingly.

If you're not doing this, you should be.
