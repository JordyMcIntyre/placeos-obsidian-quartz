Fake it til you make it right?

At least that's what Amazon did with their automatic checkout. It turns out the AI was actually 1000 people.

They weren't exactly upfront about it but if we can put that aside and take a look at the use case itself.

The promise of what they were trying to achieve used a formula we love.

**Occupancy + context + automated workflows = better ux**

Basically, knowing where people are, what they're doing and improving how they interact with that space.

The context component especially has taken huge leaps with the improvements in AI and computer vision.

That's because we're able to extract way more relevant information like in this example, what's in their cart. Once you know that, you can automate the payment process when they exit.

It's these kinds of use cases that we're exploring, we even discuss a bunch of these on one of our latest podcast episodes. Check the comment section for more.
