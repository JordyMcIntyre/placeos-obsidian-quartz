Running at 100% office capacity is 100% efficient ‚ùå

Not quite... Here's why:

If you've got a flexible work policy where teams pick and choose where they work based on their needs, it just won't happen.

Even if you had a 100% in-office policy, the chance that everyone is going to be in every day of the week is pretty much zero, there's still:  
  
- leave  
- travel  
- external meetings

But let's go back on the workplaces who have some kind of hybrid setup. What is the optimal utilization score and how do you manage it?

Here's everything you need:

- **occupancy tracking** (how many people are coming in)  
- **desk booking system** (so people can secure a space to work)  
- **desk assignment logic** (so they can sit near their colleagues)  
- **some buffer** (just in case, think company-wide workshops)

That way you can figure out how much space you need, how much buffer you need and a system that can support it. Now you can decide what's right for your workplace. It could be 80% capacity with 20% buffer.

But what happens if you're hitting 100% capacity for desk bookings?

Then it's time to:

- **prioritize who needs to come into the office** (use a booking approval process or logic to make this easy to manage)  
- **increase the amount of desks in your space** (if you can)  
- **utilize coworking spaces near your office** as an alternative location
