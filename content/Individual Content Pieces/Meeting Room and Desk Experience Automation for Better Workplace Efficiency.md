What do people want from a meeting room?

Since most meetings are between 2-3 people, it‚Äôs privacy and comfort (and of course availability).

That translates to climate, air quality, and good acoustics (and real-time occupancy workflows).

And having workflows to automate them.

Then if needed, AV. Although I think the role of AV in meeting rooms is shifting towards being the eyes and ears for AI as an interface. Stephen & I did an episode for our podcast on this exact topic (see comments)

**And what about desks?**

It‚Äôs more than somewhere to sit and work for the day.

More than a second screen.

People don‚Äôt work in isolation, they work in teams and departments.

And those departments interact with each other. Marketing with product, sales with finance, etc.

People want to know if others from their team are coming in.

The simplest way is through work location status- most calendars or comms tools offer this and so do we (with added occupancy context).

But then you‚Äôll want to sit together.

Depending on how workplaces operate, be that across the entire office or by neighborhoods, changes the approach.

If it's across the entire office, one approach is to populate desk bookings organically from the ground up and group by teams.

The more common approach is by neighborhood.

Departments are assigned a neighborhood and have an allocated number of desks.

But what if your neighborhood is always at full capacity and next door is at 30%?

To add flexibility, you want to dynamically shift some of that allocation to the neighborhood that needs it.

Most workplaces do this manually, we‚Äôre able to do it automatically in real-time.

And finally, the desk itself, yes you want a nice desk to work at- with one usb-C for power and monitors. We take this a step further by using that connection as a check-in process for more accurate desk utilization data.

If it‚Äôs sit-to-stand you can save a certain height as a preference, so when your booking starts, it‚Äôs set to that.

Basically it comes down to removing friction, being connected to the right data sources, and then being able to automate those friction points for better experience and efficiency.
