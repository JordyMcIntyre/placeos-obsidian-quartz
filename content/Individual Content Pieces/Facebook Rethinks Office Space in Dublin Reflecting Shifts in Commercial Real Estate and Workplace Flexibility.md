In 2018, Facebook signed a 25 year lease on Fibonacci Square, a 375,000-square-foot office in Dublin.

In 2022, they decided to sublet the final phase of the Ballsbridge campus.

Albeit, attributed to job cuts, there's no denying the modern world has changed. And the way organizations are consuming commercial real estate has changed with it.

This isn't just about empty desks; it's about a $280 trillion industry adjusting to the realities of modern business. The need for flexible models and alignment with customer needs has never been more vital.
