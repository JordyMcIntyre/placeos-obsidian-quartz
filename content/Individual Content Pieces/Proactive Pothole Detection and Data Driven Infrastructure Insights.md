Everybody hates potholes.

And everybody hates hitting potholes even more.

The problem with hitting potholes and then having them fixed is it's reactive. The better approach is proactive. This is where you're actively collecting data to identify potential issues and addressing them. That's exactly what Compass IoT are doing right now.

This proactive approach is what we like most. It's something that's also only possible if you're collecting the right data and context while having the ability to take immediate action.

While potholes aren't related to smart building projects, there's a lot we can learn from other industries by sharing our experiences and insights. And there was certainly no shortage of that with Emily Bobis conversation with Jonathan McFarlane on the latest episode of the PlaceOS Podcast.
