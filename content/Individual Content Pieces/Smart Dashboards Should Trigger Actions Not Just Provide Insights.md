Dashboards don't do anything.

Meaning they're passive. Yes, they can:

- provide transparency and alignment  
- guide future decisions  
- validate prior actions  
- give insights

All of which, isn't active.

To take it a step further, I would use that same data to trigger actions:

- Meeting room booked but no occupancy after 10 minutes? Automatically release the room.  
- HVAC on with no occupants and next class in 2 hours? Turn it off to save energy.
