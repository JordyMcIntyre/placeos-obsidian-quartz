Measuring data is only useful if there's an outcome.

Here's how we use data to produce outcomes through automation.

The recipe is simple:

→ Connect inputs  
→ Define Conditions  
→ Set Actions  
→ Test & Adjust  
→ Expand Over Time

More data gives you a better understanding of what’s happening in a space. With this detail, you can set more specific conditions and trigger smarter actions. Each new data point lets you build on what’s already in place, creating richer and more flexible automations over time.
