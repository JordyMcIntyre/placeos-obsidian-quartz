Let’s look at the metric: **desk bookings vs desk usage**

It tells us how many desks are being reserved alongside how many are actually used.

If bookings are near capacity but usage is low, there’s a disconnect.

You need to close that gap to:

→ Ensure space is available for those who will use it  
→ Get accurate data for better space planning

The fix? Desk check-in—either manually or automatically through location services.

One of our clients solved this by using their in-app digital IDs to power on the desk which functioned as a check-in process. No check-in, no power.

That way, if employees don’t show up, their desk is automatically released back into the booking pool.

How are you tracking actual desk usage in your workplace?
