Workflow automation is not the sexiest feature.

Mostly because it‚Äôs not tied to an interface/app, it‚Äôs just something that happens in the background.

To quote Futurama, ‚ÄúWhen you do things right, people won't be sure that you have done anything at all."

I think this captures workflow automation quite well.

When things are automated, people might be unaware of what's actually happening.

What people definitely do notice though, is friction.

Removing friction in workplaces starts with the premise: **Occupancy + Action.**

This can be as granular as individual profile settings that follow you around the building.  
Creating a uniform experience as you navigate your work day‚Äîautomatically setting desk height, meeting room lighting or climate, AV presets, etc.

On the facility side, knowing where everyone is to trigger actions for building efficiency.

A simple example I like to use‚Äîif everyone‚Äôs on level 15 and no one is on level 16, let‚Äôs power things down on level 16 and even limit access to prevent people using more space than needed.  
HVAC is about 30% of a commercial building‚Äôs energy bill, so any opportunity for optimization is worthwhile.

This can all be set by simple logic workflows:

If This;  
Then That.

Something that‚Äôs only possible if these systems are integrated. I made this point in a previous post where apps struggle to achieve these outcomes because of how they‚Äôre built.  
Whereas platforms, it's more about the integration and then the apps sit on top of the integrations purely as an interface meaning the efficiencies can follow you across building, systems, or apps you‚Äôre already using.
