Fridays in the office are quiet.

That's not an issue.

It means businesses have hybrid, which is great.

The issue is when the entire office is operational for the 15% of people that do turn up.

It's inefficient.

Activate what you need, when you need it.

This dynamic approach improves efficiency and reduces costs.

It's a simple recipe that we've implemented a lot, and it works.
