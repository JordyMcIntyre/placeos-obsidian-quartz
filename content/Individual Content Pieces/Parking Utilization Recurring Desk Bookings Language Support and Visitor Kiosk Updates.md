**What do parking utilization, recurring desk bookings, French Canadian & visitor kiosks have in common?**

They're part of our last WorkMate update for the year.

Here's everything you need to know:

**Parking Utilization:**  
→ Analyze how spaces are being used over time.  
→ Free up unused allocated spaces for others.

**Recurring Desk Bookings:**  
→ Set time frames for bookings.  
→ Release your desk when you’re in meetings—helping others find space.

**Expanded Language Support:**  
→ French (Canadian), Italian, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic now available.

**Visitor Kiosk Customization:**  
→ Personalize welcome messages, logos, and backgrounds for each building.
