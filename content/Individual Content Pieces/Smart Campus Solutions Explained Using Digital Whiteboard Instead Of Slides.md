Two days ago, I was a guest on a live webinar to help break down smart campus solutions.

I decided to present it a little different.

Instead of the usual slide decks and demos, I used a digital whiteboard to explain complex architecture in the simplest way possible.

Here's what I drew:

- Platform connects to thing  
- Platform receives input from thing  
- Platform uses input from thing to tell other thing, do this.

And yes, the technical term is thing.

**Why is this approach so powerful?**

- Actions can happen in the background: IF this, THEN that  
  
- If you need an interface, it's not locked inside an app, it's decoupled so the app can still function even if your hardware changes.

Thank you to Disha Moses & Cisco Meraki for inviting me on!
