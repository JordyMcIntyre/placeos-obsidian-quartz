In 2050, 80% of what will be built, already exists.

That means we can't rely on new builds to carry us to net zero targets.

Some of the stats*:

*   40% GHG from the built environment
*   76% of energy use is operations in a building
*   30% of energy in buildings is wasted
*   ~ 40% reduction in energy use if occupancy is factored

Add to that mandates are being introduced around the globe, some places starting with carrot but most turning towards the stick (local law 97 in NYC fining buildings per square foot, UK laws preventing landlords leasing buildings if they don't meet requirements)

Despite all of this, action still feels sluggish.

Well, that's what Ciaran O'Connell and NetZeroIQ are solving for. It's about finding alignment for building owners, execs and board members so that the incentives = net zero.

We go into an extensive discussion about the challenges, intricacies and solutions for reaching net zero in commercial real estate, to listen go here: [https://lnkd.in/g7iySHJJ](https://lnkd.in/g7iySHJJ)
