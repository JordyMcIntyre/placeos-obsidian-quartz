Leases are expiring.

Utilization is stagnant.

The way we've done workplace has changed forever.

We still need offices, it used to be mandatory, now it's a choice.

In 1 article with 7 short videos, I've attempted to show how we make that choice worthwhile.  
Let me know if you think there's anything I've missed and if there's enough input I can do another video covering that.
