It was a pleasure to be part of the University of Sydney’s business school mentorship program.

I was lucky to be assigned Richard - he's an aspiring entrepreneur who is hardworking and creative.  
I highly recommend him to anyone seeking an intern, junior, or associate for their business consulting or venture capital team.

I wish you all the best **Richard Dang**!
