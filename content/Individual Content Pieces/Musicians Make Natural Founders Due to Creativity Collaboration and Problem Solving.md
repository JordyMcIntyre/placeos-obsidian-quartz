Many founders have a background in music. This is true for Matt Fairhurst, and it was great to hear his founding story at the Blackbird Sunrise conference.

Here are a few reasons why I think musicians make natural founders.

🍻 There are transferable skills of mixing focus work with collaboration: solo instrument practice all week and jamming on weekends.

🎸 There is a musician's preference for passion projects over making money.

🎭 There is a performer's attitude that the show must go on and a willingness to compromise.  
You can be scrappy behind the scenes- but you are on stage at 8 pm no matter what.

🧠 Music trains the brain to rapidly switch from left to right hemisphere functions- which is great for problem-solving.

🧘‍♂️ There is the experience of being part of something bigger than yourself.  
Sometimes when you're jamming, you get in a zone where you feel like you are channelling something from somewhere else.  
You are just the vessel.  
Perhaps this is a little too spiritual, but I think this happens in good companies too.

Are you a musician?
