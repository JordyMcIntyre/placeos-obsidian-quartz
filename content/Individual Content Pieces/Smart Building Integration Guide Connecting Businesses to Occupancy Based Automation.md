**The only smart building solution guide you'll need.**

In one live demonstration.

Buildings represent a significant part of any business’s expenses, from operational costs to energy consumption. One of the most common issues is that none of the systems, software or devices really talk to each other. To create any kind of efficiencies in the space around you, there are two key pieces of information:

**Are there people in a space?**  
**What do they want to do?**

Then it’s about improving the experience around them by integrating with relevant technology through occupancy-based automation.

**Integration & Automation**

We’ll show you:

How we connect your business to your building through integration.

The types of data we’re able to abstract like occupancy and energy.

What data looks like once we’ve abstracted it.

How we use data to set conditions.

How we create workflow automations using those conditions to trigger actions.

How integrations translate into interface.

Expect a straightforward demonstration on how to set up a smart building solution.
