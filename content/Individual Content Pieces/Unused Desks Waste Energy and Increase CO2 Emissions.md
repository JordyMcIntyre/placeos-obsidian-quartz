You've probably seen this crazy stat!

A single unused desk equates to 1 ton of unnecessary CO2 into the atmosphere per year.  
  
(by powering the unused space)

Which **IS** crazy.

Especially since the solution is so simple...

1. Condense people into a smaller area.  
2. Turn off what you're not using.

All of this can be done dynamically, by integrating into occupancy data and then using workflow automation for your space to breathe in and out.
