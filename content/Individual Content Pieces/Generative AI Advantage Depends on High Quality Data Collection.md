According to a new survey from IBM, 72% of top CEOs think that competitive advantage depends on who has the most advanced generative AI.

But do all these companies actually have enough data to use genAI properly?

Don’t get me wrong, AI has the potential to be an absolute game changer so I am not surprised CEOs are getting excited about all the potential use cases.  
But right now, a lot of people talking a big game don’t actually have enough high-quality data to do anything meaningful with it.

If companies want to get ahead of the competition by using genAI in the near future, they need to focus on the data they are collecting right now.  
It can’t be locked into the platforms of different point solutions, and the data needs to be accurate, structured and meaningful.

GenAI is going to be big.  
But only if we set the right foundations.
