Here's everything you DON'T need to do using our visitor management:

- Provide access into the building (auto-sends credentials)  
- Figure out parking logistics (allocate space, use licence plate recognition)  
- Greet every visitor in person (kiosks for check in)  
- Tell people how to get there (turn by turn wayfinding)
