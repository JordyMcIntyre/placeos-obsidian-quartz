35% of workplaces are measuring occupancy like this.

1, 2, 3, 4... Literally counting people.

That's the latest, according to CBRE's report on Workplace Occupancy.

And it's surprising, they don't really expect that to change much.

What's even more surprising is that less than half of workplaces are using WIFI to track utilization. And it's trending down!

That's because, out of the different ways to track utilization, it's the only one that's already installed in every workplace.

It also tracks granular utilization metrics like:

‚Üí Dwell time  
‚Üí Real-time occupancy

On top of that, it gives you metadata via authentication. You know who that person is and what team they're apart of. This means you can build experiences around your people which leads to outcomes like:

‚Üí Better productivity by facilitating people  
‚Üí Better space utilization by understanding how people use space  
‚Üí Reduced energy costs by automating building systems

It's the best place to start if you want an efficient workplace.
