We used to call it the Harvey Norman effect.

It's where people expect consumer level experience and efficiency in the workplace.

It's not wrong to expect that.

That should be the standard.

But there are a few extra hoops to jump through in order to achieve that:

*   legacy systems (old buildings with old tech)
*   access to building systems (tenants can't get access)
*   security (old stuff, easy to hack)
*   variety (every building has different tech)
*   scale (every building has different tech)

Add to that, workplaces are more dynamic than ever.

The solution for most of that is by connecting everything you can.

*   abstracting legacy system data into something useful
*   being connected to enough different data to still provide a solution
*   integrate old stuff so it's protected by modern security standards
*   a large library of integrations to cover everything
*   make tech hot swappable so when you scale, experience stays the same

Then, in order to be dynamic, real time data needs to trigger actions. That way the workplace can react to what people need, when they need it.

Which makes the workplace worth coming in to.
