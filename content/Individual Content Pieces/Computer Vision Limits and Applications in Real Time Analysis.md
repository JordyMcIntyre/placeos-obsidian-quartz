Computer vision can't tell the difference between a punch and a handshake.

But people expect it to.

So I'll break down how it works, how to use it and why people are confused about it.

Computer vision can identify:  
- objects (people, cars, animals, bags, cups, tools, equipment, etc)  
- features (age, sex, hair colour, car type, car colour)  
- some gestures (if it's clear)

Computer vision can't identify:  
- behavior  
- intent

It doesn't know what anything means, just that it's there. It's programmatic, it operates like a computer...

Unlike LLMs which mimics human interpretation.

The confusion stems from people thinking they're the same.

Technically, you could use an LLM like a reverse DALL-E but it's currently compute intensive and expensive to run. Processing every frame for a 24/7 video feed would cost too much right now.

Whereas computer vision analyzes data at specific moment in time, doesn't require complex reasoning or long-term memory and has lower computational load. This makes it ideal for scalable, real-time tasks.

Which is where logic-based actions come in:

- Person A leaves belongings in Meeting Room C.  
- Computer vision identifies the belongings.  
- PlaceOS cross-references scheduling data to find who used the room.  
- Notification is triggered to Person A.

Computer vision provides more data and context for more tailored workflows and experiences.

Curious to see what people think. How do you see computer vision being used in your industry?
