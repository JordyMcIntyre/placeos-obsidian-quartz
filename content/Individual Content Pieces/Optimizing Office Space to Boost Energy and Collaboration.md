You can't deny coworking spaces have a great vibe.

It makes sense that offices are looking to emulate that.

But it's not so simple.

It's people that generate energy and buzz in an office.

Some workplaces have resorted to mandating office days, others tried to entice using pizza.

That doesn't really achieve the right outcome.

The office needs to facilitate people's needs. Provide the right type of spaces.

Then you can use a simple adjustment which will increase that vibe.

**Consolidate your space based on occupancy trends.**

If 30% of the workforce is using 100% of the building, it makes the space feel empty, silent, absent of energy.

When you get 30% of your people using 30% of the space.  
It will naturally generate that energy, buzz and vibe you're looking for.
