While QR codes may not be the most riveting topic to discuss over hors d'oeuvres, I must confess I love them. My fascination with QR Codes stems from their ability to connect the physical world with the accessibility of the web, allowing us to access context-based interfaces effortlessly. For example, each morning, I scan the QR Code at the bus stop to determine if I should wait for the bus (it provides a live tracking web interface) or opt for the tram instead‚Äîit's probably the only government-produced interface I enjoy using!

My first QR Code experience was over a decade ago in Hong Kong when I was paying at restaurants. We often take new technology for granted, but I vividly remember being awestruck by the seamless checkout process facilitated by QR Codes and WeChat.

Since then, I've advocated using QR codes in physical building user experiences. It's refreshing to see that QR Codes have become just as common in Western markets as in Asia, partly due to the pandemic. As such, I'd like to summarise where and why we use QR Codes across different PlaceOS interfaces. Screenshots included.

**üì∫ Room booking panel and AV Control:** QR Codes enable users to make bookings on their own devices rather than struggling with an on-screen keyboard at an awkward typing angle. Furthermore, QR Codes can link to additional actions, such as AV control or waiter calls, making them an ideal alternative to rolling out additional touch panels.

**üó∫ Points of interest:** QR codes can link to a specific location on a floor plan that provides real-time data. This feature allows for self-guided tours and way-finding, making it easier for visitors to navigate the building. Additionally, emergency services and first responders can access PlaceOS floor plans through the QR codes, which display real-time location data that can be helpful for evacuation planning. We link the QR Code with a floor and/or X,Y coordinates.

**üñ• Desk check-in:** Generating a QR Code for each desk simplifies the check-in process. We can also offer incentives for using QR Codes, such as turning on desk power upon check-in or gamifing the action. You can add sensors or other tracking technology, but you may not need to.

**üëØ Visitor check-in:** By emailing visitors a QR Code, they can quickly check-in, notify their host, and even access the building with a simple scan from their mobile devices.

Are we overly enthusiastic about QR Codes? Perhaps, but their practicality and versatility in location-based interfaces make them undeniably valuable and essential for creating seamless user experiences.
