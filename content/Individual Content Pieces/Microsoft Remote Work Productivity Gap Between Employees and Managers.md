Microsoft asked their employees if they think they're productive working from home?

87% said yes.

They also asked their managers, are you confident that your team's productive working from home?

Only 12% said yes.

It's a massive disparity, but why? Well, in regards to knowledge workers, it's difficult to measure. If you have a whole day of valuable thinking or problem solving but aren't able to produce an outcome just yet, how can that be measured whether or not that time spent was productive?

It's a real challenge.

Tica Masuku makes some great points and shares valuable insights into how workplace strategies are aiming to tackle these questions. For the full podcast, listen here: [https://lnkd.in/g_vKCnS7](https://lnkd.in/g_vKCnS7)
