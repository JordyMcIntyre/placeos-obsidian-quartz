Everyone‚Äôs debating which work from home policy is best. But not many people talk about what to actually do about it.

While the stats seem pretty clear, a flexible hybrid approach is best, it's not clear how to implement it.

That‚Äôs understandable. Even the high-level questions are complex:

‚ûî What is the purpose of the physical space?  
‚ûî How do we coordinate everyone if they‚Äôre not in the office all the time?  
‚ûî How do we maintain work culture?

There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve put together a series of sorts to break down everything involved in implementing an effective office policy.

Here‚Äôs what to expect:

‚ûî **Common Workplace Challenges:** Identify the most prevalent issues in adapting to new work models.

‚ûî **Data-Driven Decision Making:** How to collect workplace data and make informed decisions about office space and policies.

‚ûî **Space Assessment and Design:** Assessing current space, designing flexible layouts (using PoE technology), and optimizing utilization.

‚ûî **Implementation Steps:** Detailed steps for implementing hybrid policies, engaging employees, and measuring success and ROI.
