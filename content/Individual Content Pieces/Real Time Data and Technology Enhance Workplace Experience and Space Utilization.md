Diversity is on every value statement yet they park that at the front door of their office buildings with a one size fits all approach.

There is too much focus on efficiency and utilization.

There's not enough focus on space and experience that aligns with people's real needs.

To achieve that, you need real-time data and context.  
Then you need the ability to act on it.  
This is where technology has a major role to play.
