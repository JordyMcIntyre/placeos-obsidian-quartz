What's the best way to measure productivity?

It's the question every workplace strategy aims to answer. But it doesn't operate in a silo and it's not the only metric that matters.

We know that happiness, health and wellbeing has a positive impact on productivity. And having people operate at their absolute maximum is actually counterproductive. It‚Äôs about finding that balance between many different aspects that align with business goals as well as the wellbeing of everyone involved.

Maybe the best way to measure productivity is to measure the things that impact it.

This is just the tip of the iceberg on everything workplace strategy, human geography and more from our latest podcast episode with Tica Masuku from Charter Hall.
