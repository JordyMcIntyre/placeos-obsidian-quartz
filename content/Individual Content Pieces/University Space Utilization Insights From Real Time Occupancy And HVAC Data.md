Most universities rely on schedules to determine space usage. But scheduled occupancy ≠ real-time occupancy. And here’s the proof.

We analyzed live data from a university campus, comparing:

→ Expected attendance vs. actual attendance  
→ Class schedules vs. HVAC use  
→ Occupancy vs. CO2 levels  
→ Real-time class status vs. humidity, temperature, and carbon levels

Here’s what we found:

**1️⃣ Large disparity between expected and actual attendance**—rooms were often underutilized.

**2️⃣ HVAC could reduce run time by 6 hours per week**—saving energy without affecting comfort.

**3️⃣ Humidity levels dropped below the desired threshold**, impacting air quality.

**4️⃣ CO2 levels spiked when occupancy was high**, signaling a need for better ventilation management.

By integrating WiFi data, HVAC, sensors, and scheduling systems, universities can move beyond assumptions and make data-driven decisions about how spaces are used.

This can all be simulated before making any changes, ensuring every adjustment is backed by real insights.

How is your campus using real-time data?
