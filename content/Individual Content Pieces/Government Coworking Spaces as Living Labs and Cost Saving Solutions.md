**Why would a government run its own coworking space?**

**First- it's a living lab.**

Running an internal co-working space allows organizations to A/B test layouts, technology, and ways of working. Same thing we do for apps, websites, and ad campaigns.

Combine hard data like utilization with soft data like feedback.  
  
ie use is up for hybrid flexible space but there's feedback for more storage space for personal items.

**Second- real estate savings.**

This means centralizing spaces across agencies instead of leasing more buildings.

**How?**

Through authentication so everyone's credentials give them access to the space.  
Those same credentials provide data to chargeback departments on space use to simplify budgets.

Run the experiment. Learn from the data. Adapt in real-time.

Would you consider an internal co-working model for your organization?

**Why not?**
