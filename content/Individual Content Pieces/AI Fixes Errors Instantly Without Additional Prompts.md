What blows my mind about AI is its ability to fix errors on the fly.

See the attached example with our native ChatGPT plugin. It made a mistake, let me know while I was waiting, and fixed it without any additional prompting—all within seconds—much faster than using a web form to find and book a room.

If there were a formatting error in a traditional interface, it would fail, and I would have to report a bug.
