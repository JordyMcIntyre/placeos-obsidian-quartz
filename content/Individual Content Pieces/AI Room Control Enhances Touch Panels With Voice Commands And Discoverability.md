**AI Room Control**

**What is it?**

It's natural language to control the space around you.

**Why is this good?**

Two reasons.

**1 -** This adds an extra layer of capability to touch panels and kiosks. Instead of having to code every function onto the graphical interface, you can have these capabilities available to you as prompts or requests. This keeps the graphical interface clean and simple while capturing a wider range of use cases.

**2 -** It changes these devices to points of discoverability in the building. Providing more information, control and experience for people using the space.

You can see the demo in person at integrate alongside our partners AOPEN APAC.
