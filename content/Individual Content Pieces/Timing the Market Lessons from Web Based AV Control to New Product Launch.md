Timing is everything in business.

Almost 15 years ago, Steve and I started a web-based AV control business together. We were too early—no one got it. The incumbents had too strong a hold. So we shifted to web-based smart building workflows.

Now, my inbox is full of AV leads.

We started our journey at a pub (The Royal near USYD), and now we’re dusting off our AV expertise to launch a new AV product and brand, built on top of our PlaceOS platform.

Once again, we’re sharing ideas over beers—a little older, a little wiser, and just as motivated for the future.

Stay tuned.
