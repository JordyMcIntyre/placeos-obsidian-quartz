I won't be doing a boring slide deck presentation. 🙅‍♂️

Instead, I'm asking you to put me on the spot.

Give me your hardest questions about everything smart campus.

It doesn't matter if you're IT, facilities, system integrators or even faculty and students.

I'll answer everything you've got, no slides, just me and a whiteboard.

**Where:** [https://lnkd.in/gCMAvYFw](https://lnkd.in/gCMAvYFw)  
**When:** Tuesday at 1PM Sydney time.
