The balance between improving UX and quality human interaction is delicate.

Take the front desk of a commercial building.

You're balancing speed and hospitality. Making guests feel welcome while providing simple and speedy access.

On one end of the scale, if everyone has to line up at the front desk for access, that's too slow.

On the other end, if there's only kiosks, the hospitality element is impacted.

Finding the balance between good UX and good service improves both aspects.

But what if all of the concierge kiosks could provide the same level of service and hospitality?  
What if every kiosk had an avatar that could answer any questions about the building?  
How would that change things?  
Can AI and AV can combine to create human-like interactions and at what cost?

It's these kinds of questions Cameron, Cecilia, Hao X., Lawrence & I will be discussing at Integrate Expo.

If you haven't got tickets yet, they've given me a code **INT20OFFSPEAK**

I hope to see many familiar faces for what will be an interesting discussion.
