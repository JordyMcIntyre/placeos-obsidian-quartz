First, there were too many tablets.

Then, there were too many apps.

Now, there is AI.

What does this mean for interface design?

Well, it's changing the way we interact with apps.

It's even changing the way we do things at PlaceOS.

Instead of filling out a desk booking form, you can simply ask the AI, "book me a desk tomorrow".

However, a lot of the tools that we use for interface design are still focused on the app interface, buttons, forms, clicks, taps.

And it's where most people start... but what if we don't need that anymore? Or need it as much?  
What if we could remove that interaction?
