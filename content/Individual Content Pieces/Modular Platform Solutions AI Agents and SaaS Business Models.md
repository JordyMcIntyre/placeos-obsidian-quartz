With new products and features launching in the coming weeks, I wanted to share some thoughts on why we’re taking this approach. In this article, I explore:

✅ Why modular, packaged solutions built on a platform outperform stand-alone SaaS apps  
✅ Why SaaS isn’t the only business model worth considering  
✅ The role of AI agents in a platform-based ecosystem

These principles have shaped our latest innovations, and I’d love to hear your thoughts—check it out!
