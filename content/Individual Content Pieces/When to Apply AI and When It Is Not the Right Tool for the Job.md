Stephen & I talk about AI almost every day.

Now we've decided to record those conversations.

The first episode covers an important topic:

When to apply AI... and more importantly, when not to apply AI.

It's the age-old adage, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

It goes back to first principles, what's the outcome you are trying to achieve  
then applying the best tool for the job at the right time.

Enjoy.
