If you've ever gone through a tender process, you'll know what I'm talking about...

For those that don't know. It's a long, long list of requirements.

Basically the longest wishlist you've ever seen.

The people bidding provide yes, no, partial compliance statements with an area for comment (usually a sentence or two).

I see the same issues time and time again:

**Missed opportunities & assumptions:** You can't ask for what you don't know about.  
  
Businesses often employ consultants to figure out and advise what's best. This is accomplished by surveying end users, HR, IT, Facilities, sales etc. There will be some sound requirements but also, people asking for solutions based on how they're working with technology today, not what it could be. An example is meeting rooms, I need a form to fill out... Well, what if the technology makes that redundant?

**Overly prescriptive:** Tenders aren't small with hundreds and almost thousands of questions.  
  
Just because there are lots of questions doesn't mean you'll cover everything. This might seem counterintuitive but it's more limiting because it's not open ended. You're constrained by a thousand questions.

**Contradicting requirements:** You'd be surprised how often I see this.  
  
An example- "The solution needs to have APIs to develop with" but also "easy enough for any end user to manage integrations". You can't have both.

The solution is (un)surprisingly simple, there needs to be a more open-ended and consultative approach that allows vendors (who deal with this everyday, rather than once every 5-10 years) to showcase their value in more than just a yes, no, kind of answer.

It feels like I'm just complaining about tenders and maybe I am. But I can't be the only one who has a bit of tender fatigue?
