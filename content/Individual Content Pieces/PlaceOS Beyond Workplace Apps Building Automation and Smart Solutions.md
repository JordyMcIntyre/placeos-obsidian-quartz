**RE-UP:** We are not a workplace app.

That might be weird for us to say...

Especially considering the bulk of our large scale enterprise projects use our workplace app ü§î

Really, PlaceOS is an abstraction layer to be built on top of.

It can be a building automation solution.  
It can be an energy reduction solution.  
It can be a smart campus solution.  
It can be a telehealth solution.

And yes, it can be a workplace app too.

However, you don't even need our workplace app to run PlaceOS in your building.

Here's what we mean by that ‚¨áÔ∏è
