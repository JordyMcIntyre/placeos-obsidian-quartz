If you want to analyze your building's performance, you'll need data.

And then some more data.

Then you can start to draw conclusions by overlaying each dataset and identifying correlations.  
Eventually you draw enough correlations and you get context.

When you combine data and context, you get insights.

Then you can take action. And ideally, you automate those actions.
