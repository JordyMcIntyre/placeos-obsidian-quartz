Let’s look at the metric: **bookings by department**.

It tells us who the power users are.

It doesn't tell us why they're power users though.

Maybe this space suits their needs better than others. Maybe it’s just the default option. That’s where soft data comes into play.

- Feedback scores add context to raw metrics.  
- Utilization + experience data = smarter space planning.  
- Low bookings + bad feedback? Something needs to change.

Hard data tells you what’s happening.

Soft data tells you why.

Are you combining both when making workplace decisions?
