New energy legislation putting £93 billion at risk.

The UK Government has mandated that commercial buildings have an EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) rating of at least E to be let – which also applies to existing tenancy agreements.

Recent estimates place numbers at 11.4% of commercial real estate fail to meet these new requirements.
