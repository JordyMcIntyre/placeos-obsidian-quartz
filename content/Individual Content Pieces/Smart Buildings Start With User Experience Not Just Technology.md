Steve Jobs was right about this one.

**User experience first.**

**Technology second.**

So often we see organizations starting with the technology and working their way backwards.

It's the wrong approach.

You should ask yourself, what outcomes am I trying to achieve then see where technology can be used to support that journey.

There's even times where the technology is already in your building...  
  
You just didn't know you could use it that way.
