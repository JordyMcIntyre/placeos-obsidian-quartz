You probably overlooked this workplace requirement.

That‚Äôs because there's a lot to consider in a hybrid workplace.

Desk booking. Meeting rooms. Collaboration spaces.

But if everything‚Äôs flexible‚Ä¶ where do people put their stuff?

A government agency running a co-working model found that 31% of employees needed a place to store personal items.

Lockers are the obvious answer, but they need to be just as flexible as the workplace itself.

**Here's how we do it**

‚Üí Employees can pick & book lockers when they need it.  
‚Üí Admins assign, open, and manage them dynamically.  
‚Üí Create booking rules for departments, teams, or groups to guide how people use it.

**What else is your workplace missing?**
