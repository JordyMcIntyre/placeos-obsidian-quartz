Parking is always limited at the office:

→ Before you drive in you'd like to know if there's a spot.  
→ Inviting a guest in for meeting, they might need a spot.  
→ Some people have reserved spaces but aren't always in.

Here's how we address that:

→ Car space booking to see what's available  
→ When you invite a visitor you can add a parking reservation for them  
→ Licence plate recognition/access control integrations can recognize if people aren't in to make those spots available
