James Dice has been ahead of the curve when it comes to having an understanding of the building industry, the problems it faces and how to solve them. That's why it was great to join him on his podcast, Nexus Labs.

We got to talk, why user experience should be at the forefront of every solution, tenant experiences, the platform approach, and how we're tackling different industry verticals plus heaps more.
