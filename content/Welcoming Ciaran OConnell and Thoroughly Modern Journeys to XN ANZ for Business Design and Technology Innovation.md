We are thrilled to welcome Ciaran O'Connell O’Connell and his team at Thoroughly Modern Journeys to the XN ANZ network. Ciaran is a highly experienced consultant who held senior roles at Deloitte and IBM before he set his own niche consultancy with a focus on business design to get the best value from technology.

Ciaran and his team help clients evaluate and exploit emerging and disruptive technologies for customer experience, business efficiency, workforce productivity, and societal trust. They take a customer, employee, and organisation perspective by determining each of their modern journeys.

They advise executives about how their organisations can ready themselves for the future of work, designing for improved workforce performance and an engaging culture with new technologies and partner ecosystems.

As part of the XN community, Ciaran (working with Nicola Mansfield from TheDesignThinkers) have already developed a compelling and integrated service offer for the real estate and construction sector. Their joint experience and skills help clients realise increased value from property by using advanced analytics, an understanding of human behaviour and better design for future work patterns.
