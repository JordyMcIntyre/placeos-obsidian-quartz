My wife received a phone call from a friend one day.

They were in hospital in Lisbon and needed help.

She had to translate english to portuguese for them so that they could receive healthcare.

Translators are a key component of healthcare, especially with the world being more multicultural and well travelled.

But there's some things that get lost in translation.

At least, that's the feedback we've received talking to healthcare professionals.

Whether that's due to embarrassment, medical jargon being misinterpreted, simplifying or emphasising the wrong information, whatever it may be.  
The translation is an added layer of complexity.

This isn't a knock on translators, it's a difficult task, but it does become a little subjective from translator to translator.

However, the introduction of Chat GPT changes all of that. It's able to translate with greater consistency in real time.

And it's at the fingertips of everyone with a smartphone.

For our own telehealth solution, we have logic that can automatically add translators into the call, but now, we're able to integrate AI into the solution, making translation available at any time.

It's exciting times to see all of the ways LLM's, AI and machine learning can improve user experience.

Curious to see what ways other people are integrating this technology into their solutions.
