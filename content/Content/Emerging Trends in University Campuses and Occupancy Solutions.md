For those of you who don't know, we've recently released a monthly newsletter where we talk about emerging trends, how we're improving PlaceOS and ultimately, how we can all get to a better place.

This is our second edition where we talk emerging trends on university campuses, when to go with a custom or packaged solution and how an object detection sensor can be used to improve occupancy workflows.
