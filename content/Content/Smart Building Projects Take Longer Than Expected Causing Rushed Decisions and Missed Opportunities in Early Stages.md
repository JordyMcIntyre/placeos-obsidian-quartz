Smart building projects take two times longer than expected for clients. But it takes four times longer than expected for the company delivering it.

This leads to feeling the need to rush things through which can be detrimental to the project. Especially so during the early stages like processes of discovery and scoping. These moments are crucial because:

A) You want to make sure you're not missing anything.  
B) You want to be looking for new opportunities.

Measure twice, cut once.
