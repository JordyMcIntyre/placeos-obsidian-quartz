 We've known this for a long time.

If you factor occupancy into building operations, you can create efficiencies across every aspect.

This is a study from 2017.

It states you can reduce consumption from 10-40%.

This is before covid. Before hybrid workplaces.

Flashforward to today.

The workplace is more dynamic than ever.

This puts greater emphasis on occupancy-based automation than ever.

Something that can only be achieved if you're connected to the right data with the ability to automate.
