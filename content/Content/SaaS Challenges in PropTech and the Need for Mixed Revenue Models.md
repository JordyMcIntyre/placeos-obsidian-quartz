SaaS is a great business model when it stacks up. However, the challenge is deferring and collecting revenue over time, rather than getting it upfront. And the risk is customers can unsubscribe at any time.

In PropTech, many construction, office relocation, and retrofit projects run from capital budgets and cannot use the pool of funds for operating expenses—such as SaaS subscriptions.

The same is true for grants and donations, such as the billions of dollars in energy reduction grants available to commercial building owners and operators.

For a PropTech business, I think a healthy mix of business models and revenue streams is required. I'm increasingly frustrated by venture capital firms that discount CapEx models and show little understanding of how customers purchase in our industry. They must be missing out on so many opportunities.
