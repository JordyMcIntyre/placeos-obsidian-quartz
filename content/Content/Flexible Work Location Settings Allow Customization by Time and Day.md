Hybrid work is more flexible than, "my office days are Tuesday through Thursday".

You might have a collaborative session with your team in the morning and the rest of the day is back to back calls.  
Take those calls at home.

It's these kinds of scenarios we want to cater for in WorkMate. That's why we've updated our work location settings to reflect this.

Set your location by time and day.
