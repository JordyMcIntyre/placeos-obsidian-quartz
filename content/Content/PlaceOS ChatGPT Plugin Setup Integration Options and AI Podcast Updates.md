We updated our technical docs page to detail setting up any PlaceOS instance with our ChatGPT plugin. (native Copilot directly in MS Windows is coming soon).

This means  
1. you can hook this up to your own MS Azure API (it doesn‚Äôt all run through us).  
2. Anyone running PlaceOS can have ChatGPT as an interface.

And like anything PlaceOS, you have three options: DIY, hire us or engage with a PlaceOS partner.

It‚Äôs currently focused on room and desk booking (see my last posts for examples). But let us know what integration drivers to expose to OpenAI next. Access? Energy management?

**One last thing:** follow the PlaceOS LinkedIn page - we have three AI podcast episodes about to drop with my mate and cofounder Stephen Von Takach. We enjoy talking about AI on air so much we are considering pitching ‚Äúthe AI Guys Podcast‚Äù to Spotify.
