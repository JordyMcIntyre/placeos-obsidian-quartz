We ran a POC for a government agency.

The project was a coworking style hub for all their departments.

They never expected that departments would want to book entire neighborhoods.

It makes sense though.

Conference rooms and large meeting rooms are a little one dimensional.

Neighborhoods offer a greater catalog of facilities, space types and flexibility.

This has flow on effects.

If the entire space isn't being booked out, the individual facilities inside it should be available for use.

Selecting a desk on a map becomes less important as it's more about grouping the right people together.

Allow people to select a neighborhood and then automatically assign them a desk.

We can take this a step further by grouping people in their team or department using active directory and PlaceOS logic.

**Are bookable neighborhoods practical?**
