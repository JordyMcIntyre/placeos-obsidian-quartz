It's all too common to see different departments solving the same problems or solving problems in siloes.

On some of our projects, it's the first time these departments are even meeting each other.

Ciaran's highlighted this in our podcast, teams going on major capital programs to replace HVAC but only to replace HVAC.

Not thinking about how these systems fit within the entire ecosystem.

Not thinking about what else they could do at the same time.

The challenge is a non-technical one.

It's about getting the right people in the room from different departments.  
Which is where people like Ciaran have a role to play.
