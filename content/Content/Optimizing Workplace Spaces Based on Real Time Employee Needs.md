Utilization going up from Q2-Q3 isn't going to run your business any better.

That's because utilization index reports aren't actually useful to workplaces.

What's actually useful is-

Providing your employees with what they need to do their job when they need it.

You don't get that by reading index reports, you get that by:

1Ô∏è‚É£ - Asking them  
2Ô∏è‚É£ - Collecting data from multiple sources of truth  
3Ô∏è‚É£ - Setting your own benchmarks  
4Ô∏è‚É£ - Using that data to trigger actions so the space adapts to people's need in real time  
5Ô∏è‚É£ - Making spaces modular so they can change in the moment
