There are a lot of contributing factors to improving a building's user experience. Most people immediately go for software, which can have obvious benefits but it depends on what the desired outcome is.

If you want people's experience of a space to improve you need to look at every aspect. The ambience is something that can often get overlooked, if it's too noisy or too quiet, it can be fatiguing or uncomfortable.

But you don't need to use software to achieve that, it could be as simple as installing composite materials to make the space more pleasant.

And then who knows, maybe you could combine technology with acoustics, much in the same way you would with sunlight and blinds.
