Amazon just found the most expensive way to lose employees.

Getting rid of wfh...

Why though?

There's 3 potential motivations for their decision:

- roi  
- head count  
- culture

but only one I want to focus on one- roi for their large real estate portfolio.

Like a lot of companies they've invested in new buildings/signed onto long leases and have all this empty real estate wondering what to do with it.

For them, vacancy rates sit around 30-40%, they want it below 10.

Forcing people into the office achieves that but at what cost?

- staff retention  
- talent acquisition  
- job satisfaction

All HR related but there's also operations.

If the building is at maximum capacity, it's also running at maximum capacity. Meaning costs go up- hvac, lighting, facilities, the list goes on.

At what point does it become a sunken-cost?

At what point do you decide to do something different?

There are better ways to get roi without losing all your best staff and in fact probably add to their experience:

- sublet  
- repurpose space  
- coworking

and

- have a dynamic building

Condense people into a smaller space and shut down what you're not using to save on energy. This should all be done automatically using logic so that the space breathes in and out as needed.

That way you can maintain a flexible work policy without having a dull vibe where people are isolated, spread out sporadically, across 50 floors.
