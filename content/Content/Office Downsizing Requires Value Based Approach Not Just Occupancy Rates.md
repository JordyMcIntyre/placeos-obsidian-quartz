Occupancy is the only metric you need to justify downsizing your office space. ‚ùå

Measuring occupancy is like counting calories.

Not all calories are the same, are they full of nutrients or just sugar?

That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt judge a room by its occupancy rates, it could be a boardroom with low utilization but it‚Äôs the only space that hosts high-value meetings and lands big deals.

It comes down to value, which is a lot more nuanced.

This requires a comprehensive approach, involving input from more than just real estate and finance teams, but also HR and technology teams to ensure downsizing decisions align with the values and needs of the organization.

That‚Äôs why blanket reductions do more harm than good, it doesn‚Äôt factor in value, how people are using space and why they need it.
