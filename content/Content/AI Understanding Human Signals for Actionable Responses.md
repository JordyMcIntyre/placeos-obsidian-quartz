If you need help, you put your hand up.

We were all taught that at a young age.

It's a simple way of interacting, using hand signals.

Now, AI can understand and interpret requests like this.

It takes human input like voice, text and even visual signals.  
And triggers an action.

**Input -> AI -> Action.**
