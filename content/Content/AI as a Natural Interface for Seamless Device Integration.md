If there's one thing I'd like people to understand about AI.

It's this...

**AI is an interface for everything it's connected to.**

The meeting room is a great example of what I mean by that.

It's a controlled environment with lots of devices.

Let's take a common device found in meeting rooms, a tv on the wall.

When integrated correctly, there will be a set of functions that's available for that tv (On, off, brightness, contrast, etc).

The traditional way of interacting with that display is through a graphic interface, most likely a tablet that controls a few different things in the room.

The limitation there is you have to choose what functions to display on the tablet interface and have it hard coded.

You'd most likely have on/off/input and wouldn't want much more than that because 90% of the time, it's what people need.  
Plus you want to keep it simple and leave screen real estate for other devices and functions.

The difference with AI is that it can use all of the available functions when it needs to based on the requests of the user.

Here's two simple examples:

**1Ô∏è‚É£**

The user has a vision impairment.

They tell the AI, "Hey, I'm colour blind and struggle with reds and greens, can you change the tv settings for me."

The AI has access to those functions and can change the settings based on a prompt from natural language.

**2Ô∏è‚É£**

The sun is shining on the screen making it hard to see.

"Hey, the sun is shining on the screen and it's hard to see"

The AI can not only adjust the brightness of the screen but if it's connected to the blinds too, then it can close them as well.

It's discrete, flexible and natural.

To make this work, integrations with every available function have to be in the system so you can have the desired user experience when needed.

This changes how we design solutions for spaces, it changes how we design technology and it changes how we design software.

We can forget about doing mockups of interfaces to match 20 user stories.

In most cases, by the time you've done that, there's 20 more.

We're moving on from that to say everything's connected and we can action any function inside that integration.
