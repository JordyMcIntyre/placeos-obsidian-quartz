Has anyone else contributed to a LinkedIn Collaborative Article?

If you’ve spent any amount of time on LinkedIn, I’m sure you’ve received the notifications.

They’ve got collaborative articles for almost every topic, some quite interesting with good responses.

Unfortunately, there’s also a lot of regurgitated ChatGPT answers.

Which is ironic, because the about section by LinkedIn says this, **“It starts with an article on a professional topic or skill, written with the help of AI — but it’s not complete without insights and advice from people with real-life experiences.”**

AI questions with AI answers.

To combat that, I’m aiming to add value to topics I’m close to.

The first one is about retrofitting buildings and what the key metrics / performance indicators are.
