By adding "it can be any room," I was able to book a room in one prompt in our ChatGPT plugin.

I could have added "any room with WebEx" or "any room for five people."

This prompt reminds me of the slide I used in an AI talk I gave at Cisco Live last year and is a good example of AI's declarative approach‚Äîthe slide is also attached.
