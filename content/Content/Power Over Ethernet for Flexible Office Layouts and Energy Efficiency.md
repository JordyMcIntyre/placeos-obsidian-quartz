What if you wanted to change your office layout?

How would you go about making that as easy as possible?

I'd use Power over Ethernet.

It‚Äôs nothing new but it‚Äôs seen advancements to the point it can now power devices, lighting, kiosks, sensors, cameras, and USB-C Laptops.

**Why‚Äôs this good?**

‚Üí Easier to install than using AC power  
‚Üí Cheaper to run than AC power  
‚Üí More data (like energy consumption)  
‚Üí More control (automation)  
‚Üí Future proof

Floor boxes provide easy access to power and network. You can move furniture around as needed.

Whether that be for an event, seminar, internal workshop, or function.

Of course you still need your meeting rooms, etc.

But if you can dedicate even a portion of your office to be truly flexible, you'll get much more value out of the space you're using.
