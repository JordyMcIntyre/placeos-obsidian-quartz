**3 ways AI will improve the built environment:**

**1. User Experience**

Gen AI is already shifting the experience away from apps towards a more dynamic and responsive environment that uses either chat or voice based interactions.

**2. Contextualized Data**

It's able to analyze more data and more data sources to draw many more correlations between it all, we just need to ask the right questions.

**3. Lower barrier-to-entry**

It's happened before... Advancements in technology lowers the barrier-to-entry to the point where the everyday user can start doing something with it.

Two things come to mind, music and video content. If you wanted to create a song, you needed musicians, studio time, a producer, an engineer... Now you just need a laptop.  
The same goes for video content, access to what was once production studio level technology is available to almost everyone.

I think the same thing will happen to building technology and software solutions in general. AI will lower the barrier-to-entry for users who want to engage with what was once only available to specialised roles.
