When considering new features, we always ask, "Why build this ourselves instead of integrating with a third party?"

The answer:  
  
Because we can seamlessly integrate it into our automation workflows.

That’s the case with Digital Signage, our newest WorkMate feature.

Now, signage content can be dynamically triggered by occupancy tracking, visitor management, or other building events—enhancing the smart workplace experience.

We’re showcasing it at Integrate this year at the AOPEN booth.

🤫We also have a soft launch of a new AI feature for voice control. That one requires a meeting—reach out if interested.
