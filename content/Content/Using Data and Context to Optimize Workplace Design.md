If we count how many people are coming in each day, we'll know how much space we need?

No. ‚ùå

That's because data like occupancy and utilization are only part of the picture.

The same can be said for how you set up your space. If people aren't using it, how do you know what to change?

The missing piece of the puzzle is context.

In other words, **why?**

There's some things you can't know unless you talk to people.

If the answer was because there aren't any chairs, you don't need less space, you just need somewhere to sit down.

It's a crude example but you get the point.

And when you add the needs of more teams, groups, departments, or tenants.  
Those needs become more complicated.

And consequentially, so does the **why**.

It's what John & the team at Hub Australia are getting right.

As a coworking organisation, they're balancing the needs of many by combining data and context to shape how they design their spaces.

We talk about (and do) this a lot at PlaceOS. If you want to have a conversation about how you can collect the right data, context and then do something with it, drop me a message on here.
