What a great Cisco Live! It's pretty much a wrap for me- but I'm still here for the rest of the day if you want to reach out.

Thanks to Disha for including me on your panel. Muge for all the intros (and the boost of energy every time I ran into you), Sam for your party shirt! And Collin for luring in so many leads at our booth with those (ugly yet popular) bucket hats. And thanks, Stephanie and Ana for supporting the event and your partners remotely.

Maybe I'm biased, but I enjoyed this Melbourne version over Las Vegas. Probably just the better coffee 😜
