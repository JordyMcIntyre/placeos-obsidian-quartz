You'd be surprised how one change can make a more sustainable campus.

**Are people using the space?**

**No → Turn it off**

Well, it's slightly more complicated than that but the concept remains the same. It looks a little bit more like.

**Condition:**

**IF → No more classes for >59 Minutes → Then: Shutdown**  
**IF → No more classes today → Then: Shutdown**

**IF → Classes on <59 Minutes →**  
**THEN:**  
→ Stage 1: HVAC ON  
→ Stage 2: Lights ON, Unlock Doors  
→ Stage 3: AV prepare  
→ Stage 4: AV Start

It's been shown that this one change can reduce energy consumption up to 23% in the spaces it's been implemented.

And this is just the beginning. Alongside Disha Moses I'll be walking through the concepts, projects and systems we use on campus to achieve these results and more.
