I like to hide away from everyone when I'm doing focus work.

Sometimes that requires a location where no one can find me.

Which is what I like about this project from Google & Gensler. There's such a huge catalogue of spaces for all kinds of working styles and needs.

Everything Amanda Carroll said in this video sums it up perfectly,  
  
"In today's world, people are on the move and they have so many different needs and preferences for how they want to work best throughout not only their work day, but their work week. And what we felt was that if we enabled the opportunity for somebody to find a space to work effectively, we should take it."

Which is what we should be aiming for when designing our workplaces.
