Thrilled to share that PlaceOS has been recognised as Cisco Meraki’s Global Partner of the Month! 🎉

The same day I found this out, I had an inspiring conversation with a New Zealand reseller about an exciting new project using Meraki cameras for advanced computer vision—moving beyond traditional people counting. It’s clear that customers are seeking more intelligent ways to optimise their spaces, and Meraki delivers not just the technology but also the expertise to make it happen.

It’s a privilege to work with the **Cisco Meraki** team.
