What if every day you're in the office...

You got a little bit more leave.

It's an interesting incentive.

Especially considering all the media circulation of companies like Nike mandating RTO.

Their approach is to use the stick instead of the carrot.

Which is strange because there are so many ways you can make the office more attractive.

And **tbh**, probably much more effective.
