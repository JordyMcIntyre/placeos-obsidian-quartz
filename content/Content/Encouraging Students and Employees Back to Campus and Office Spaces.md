The workplace is struggling to attract their workforce back into the office, but they're not the only ones in that position. University campuses are also struggling to attract students back.

It's a common thread among these types of spaces that don't necessarily need to operate on site anymore.  
They find themselves asking the question, how can we encourage people back?

The good thing is, it's the right kind of question to be asking. That's why we had Charlie MacDowall on the podcast.  
We discussed ideas around the role the campus plays in today's environment and how they can start to implement the right kind of changes that shape the space into something their users benefit from.  
There's a lot to take away from this, you can watch the whole conversation here: [https://lnkd.in/grU_y6EQ](https://lnkd.in/grU_y6EQ)
