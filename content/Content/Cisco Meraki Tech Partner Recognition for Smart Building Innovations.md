**Cisco Meraki tech partner of the month 😮**

We've been working with Meraki on innovative projects for smart buildings all around the globe for more than a minute.

We've been able to help so many businesses get the most out of the spaces they use every day.

We've always supported an open and platform based approach to our projects and Meraki's APIs only add to that (the devs love them).

It's an honor to be receiving this acknowledgement.
