AV has a big role to play in AI and the AV industry doesn't even know it yet.

Last week I spoke at Integrate about the ways we can interact with AI & LLMs.

Interactions are changing from:  
  
point and click - where users input information on a device  
  
to:  
  
describe and done - where you simply state your needs

Which is why AV is so important, it's the eyes and ears of AI.

For example, a touch panel isn't something you need to touch or type on anymore, it becomes a feedback device, it displays information to the user like recognition of listening, processing and displaying the results. Reducing the amount of interaction needed.

If there was glare on your meeting screen, you can ask the LLM, "hey, I can't see the screen too well, there's glare, can you fix it". The LLM has access to a large list of functions for the display, blinds, lighting and can adjust brightness, lower the blinds and drop the lighting. This would be difficult to design a graphical interface for.

(We demo'd this at Integrate, we'll do the same as a live webinar soon)

All of this fundamentally changes the way we need to think about user experience design and integration design.

**UX design:** If we don't need to point & click, what needs to be on the screen?

**Integration design:** How do we make sure the LLM has access to all of these systems, software and device functions?

If you want to know the answer to these questions, watch my talk or drop me a message, happy to discuss further for anyone interested.
