Almost every commercial building here today will still be here in 2050.

In fact, they'll make up 80% of all commercial buildings at that time.

Everything we do today will count towards reaching net zero tomorrow.

Here's why...

Commercial buildings make up 42% of all emissions.

Government bodies are drawing up mandates to set benchmarks for buildings in the form of energy ratings to address that fact.

Over the last few years, those ratings have changed from being a sign on the front of your building to a very real cost.

- In the UK, that means you can't lease your building  
- In NYC, you get fined per square foot

Here's where I'd start.

Up to 40% of energy consumption could be saved if occupancy is factored into building operations.

That means collecting data, then triggering actions in real-time.

So why isn't this common practice?

Surprisingly, it's not a technical issue. It's a stakeholder alignment issue.

Siloed departments installing siloed solutions.

Consultants have an important role to play, creating stakeholder alignment. Something Ciaran O'Connell understands well and has a lot of experience dealing with.

Which is why we've partnered in on NetZeroIQ  
Their aim, get every commercial building net zero.

How, blending together expertise from architectural engineering, esg, retrofitters, designers and technology.
