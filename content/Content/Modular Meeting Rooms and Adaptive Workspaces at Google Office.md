**Is this the most modular workplace in the world?**

I've worked on a ton of enterprise workplace projects and I've never seen this before.

It's more modular than joining a couple smaller meeting rooms to make a larger one.

Google have built a new office in New York, here's what they've done.

They have set up neighborhoods with meeting rooms that can be configured in any combination they need. For example:

8 person meeting room  
Two 4 person meeting room  
Four 2 person office spaces  
2 person / 6 person...  
and so on.

I can't imagine it being easy to implement a scheduling and booking system in this scenario, and you probably wouldn't want to.

What would be best, I think, is being as ad hoc as possible. So not forcing people to book a certain mode of room, allowing people to go in and use the space as they need in real time, in situ.

Then:

*   track real time occupancy
*   monitor utilization

Use that data for space planning to see if they need more modular rooms across this particular neighborhood versus other neighborhoods and holistically across the whole organization.

Overall, it's great to see this in action and is definitely worth exploring for your own projects, I know we'll be doing the same.

They did a lot more with desks and space types in this project but the full video went over the 15 minute limit for LinkedIn, so you'll need to head over to YouTube for that.
