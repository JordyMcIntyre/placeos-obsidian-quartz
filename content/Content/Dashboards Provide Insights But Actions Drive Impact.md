Dashboards don't do anything.

Meaning they're passive. Yes, they can:

*   provide transparency and alignment
*   guide future decisions
*   validate prior actions
*   give insights

All of which, isn't active.

To take it a step further, I would use that same data to trigger actions:

*   Meeting room booked but no occupancy after 10 minutes? Automatically release the room.
*   HVAC on with no occupants and next class in 2 hours? Turn it off to save energy.
