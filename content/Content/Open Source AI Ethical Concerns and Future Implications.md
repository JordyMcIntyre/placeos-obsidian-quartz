Are we open-sourcing the end of the world?

A little hyperbole yes, but it poses an interesting question.

Should we open source AI?

Well, Meta have already gone and done that with LLAMA 3.

And if you're thinking about what the future implications would be.

Well, you'd be excused for worrying if this is an end of man type scenario (think skynet etc.)

There's a lot more to it than the obvious though.

Which is what the latest episode is about:

→ OpenAI and AI Model Accessibility  
→ Meta LLAMA 3's approach to Open Source  
→ Costs and Investment in AI Development  
→ AI and Computing Power  
→ Impact of AI on Future Technologies  
→ AI Deployment and Commercial Use vs Open Source  
→ Ethical and Operational Implications  
→ Long-Term Implications of AI in Society
