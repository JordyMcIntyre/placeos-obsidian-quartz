How does desk booking mix with AI?

Well...

The expectation is that AI would be able to figure out common requirements like:

- Booking a desk near my colleagues.  
- Booking the desk on a certain level where my department is located.

This organic growth model is probably not the best application of AI's capabilities.

Furthermore, some more simple conditional logic programming could achieve the same outcome with much less complexity involved. It's also less error prone since the parameters are more clearly defined.

However, using AI as part of a desk booking solution as the interface is the perfect application...

Now you can simply ask:

**"book me a desk tomorrow".**

It then performs the task of booking a desk and the conditional logic programming handles the rest.
