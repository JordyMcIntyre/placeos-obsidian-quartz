Thanks to Kylie and Sabrina for a great ep of the PlaceOS podcast. The full episode covers industry trends in smart buildings, healthcare and AV. The clip below focuses on women in these verticals.

On international Women’s day here are my two cents on what men in leadership positions can do to support women..  
1. Give men (not just women) flexibility around parental leave.  
2. Pay women what they deserve- don’t negotiate them down in the hiring process.  
3. Listen- talk to your team and don’t make assumptions on what women want.

**Why?**  
It’s good for business. More women in your tech business reflects the market you are selling to, it leads to more creative ideas and a positive work environment for everyone.
