I remember the exact moment I decided to start this business. It was in my first professional role working on a brand new lecture theatre in a brand new building.

I walked into the room and there were 6 touch panels on the wall, one for internal blinds, one for outdoor shutters, one for air conditioning during business hours, one for air conditioning outside of business hours, one for AV and one for lighting control.

The only consideration for user experience was that the panels were mounted next to each other. Fast forward to today, and the same problem exists but instead of touch panels, it's apps. Now expand that same problem across every room and campus.

How can you lay the foundation for positive campus experience if you've got a different app for every interaction? It's part of why we do what we do at PlaceOS. It's also the reason that we're hosting our first hybrid event, **Rethinking Campus Experience**.

We've invited speakers Malcolm Caldwell, Chris Owens, Stephen Wilkinson GAICD & our own Sabrina Venish to showcase how they're approaching campus experience. For anyone in the industry looking to do the same, this event is for you.
