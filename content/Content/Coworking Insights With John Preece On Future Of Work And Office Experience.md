If you want to learn about something.

You go straight to the source.

For coworking, it's John Preece

For those that don't know him, he's a prominent voice in the future of work debate. And in my opinion, is pushing for all the right things.

In today's work environment we know:

*   landlords need to do more than just leasing space
*   mandates aren't the answer for getting people back in the office
*   office experience matters more than ever

And coworking is one sector that's getting those things right.

Which is why we got John on the podcast.
