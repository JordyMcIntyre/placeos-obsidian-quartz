3 out of the 57 floors at Salesforce Tower in Sydney, aren't occupied by Salesforce.

It's a coworking space for climate startups.

There's two things at play here:

**1) Repurposed unused space.**  
  
In a building like this where it's typically a single tenant on a long term lease and are looking to renegotiate their deal. A coworking space provides a flexible path forward. The main tenant's:

→ not stuck with paying for empty floors  
→ has access to overflow

**2) Agglomeration**

This is why the same type of stores cluster together. The same principle applies here:

→ Climate startups co-located in the same space create mutual benefits.  
→ Ideas, resources, and networks are shared, fostering innovation.

Other examples include ecommerce where businesses not only share workspace but warehousing as well.

Landlords and businesses could take this a step further by providing a coworking space that's relevant to the major tenant's business goals, creating an incubator.

Do you think there's potential here?

**PS*** my favourite niche coworking space is a wellness one with red light saunas and massage chairs (maybe Steve and I will record the next podcast from the massage chairs 😂)
