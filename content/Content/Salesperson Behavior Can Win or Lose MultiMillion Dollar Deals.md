**Don’t be a dickhead. It will cost you in the long run.**

In my early twenties, I had a professional job and attended a major industry trade show. I was eager to see a demo at one of the booths, but when I booked my ticket, I used my personal email—so my company name wasn’t on my lanyard.

When I approached the booth, the sales rep barely acknowledged me. Eventually, he asked, "Who signs the cheque?" after I told him where I worked, assuming it wasn’t me. I didn’t get a demo. So, I walked over to their competitor’s booth instead. Their product was nearly identical, but their approach wasn’t—they were welcoming and happy to show me what they had to offer.

Later, I recommended the competitor’s product. The first sales rep didn’t just lose my attention; he lost a multi-million-dollar sale.

Sometimes, the real difference isn’t the product—it’s the salesperson. If you're passionate about what you’re selling, show it to anyone who’s interested. You never know who’s making the decisions behind the scenes (or will be in the future).

I won’t name who lost the sale. But it was Sharp that won it.

Almost twenty years later, I still think about that experience– and how my brand preference was set early in my career.
