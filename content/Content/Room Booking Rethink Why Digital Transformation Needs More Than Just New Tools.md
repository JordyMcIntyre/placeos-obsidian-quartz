Imagine banging your head against the wall and expecting anything else but a headache.

That’s what most digital transformation projects are like.

Installing the same solution from different vendors and hoping for better results.

It won't work.

Take room booking, for example:

If the process doesn't work for you, swapping systems won’t fix it. The problem isn’t the tool, it’s the approach. So why not rethink the process entirely?

What if, instead of swapping systems, you asked:

→ Do we even need this solution?  
→ What else can we change beyond the tool itself?

The best transformations happen when you stop replacing and start reimagining.

Look at Google’s adaptive meeting rooms. No booking systems, no rigid rules—just spaces that adjust in real-time to user needs.

And yes, this might sound strange coming from me, someone with a room booking solution. But the real power is in the platform approach. A system that adapts with you, breaking free from rigid, hard-coded processes.

Maybe it’s not “room booking” anymore, it’s “room using.” (I’m sure there’s a better name out! )

So, what processes in your business need a complete rethink?
