I interviewed an AI...

It's quite surreal and almost breaks through the uncanny valley.

You know it's not real but the responses are so human-like it's easy to forget- It can be sarcastic and it makes jokes.

One of the ways I've been experimenting with these tools is for learning. I'm currently practicing Portuguese, ableit not that well. It's been extremely helpful even if the AI makes jokes about my pronunciation.

In the case of smart buildings, where I see these tools having an impact is user experience.

It's an interface that breaks away from traditional field forms where you fill out all your details and transforms it to a conversational one, whether that be through voice or chat-  
"Book a desk for next Tuesday, I prefer quiet areas because I'm doing focus work".

The interface's role in user experience is something we spend a lot of time on. Firstly, we ask ourselves does it need one? If yes, then what's the right type? When is the right time to present it?

This can expand across areas like visitor management, analytics, insights and automation. And we're really only just beginning.

Anyways, that's enough from me- keep an eye out for the video once it's released.
