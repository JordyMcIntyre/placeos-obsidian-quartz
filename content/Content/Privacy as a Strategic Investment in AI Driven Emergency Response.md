Privacy is a spend.

It's just about calibrating how, where and when to spend it.

For example, spatial audio & computer vision can play a key role in emergency situations.

Someone is calling for help, the AI can detect that which triggers an alert to send security and first aid.

In this situation, the AI can pass along who, what and where with ease.

This context is beneficial and helps achieve a better outcome.
