AV has been a shining star through COVID. A lot of innovation has had to take place over many years to get to this spot where a pandemic can roll out and people can still function relatively seamlessly. Even 5 years earlier, it would've been a very different experience.

Cameron Douglas joined us on the PlaceOS Podcast to talk everything AV, the role it's played during the pandemic, the new experiences AV's unlocking for hybrid-working environments, and much more.
