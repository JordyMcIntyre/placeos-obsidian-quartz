Leverage what you've got.

It's a mantra we live by.

It's something that proves right time and time again.

Especially for Occupancy Tracking.

Occupancy tracking is the foundation for all the best workflow automation in a building.

Meetings, visitors, energy reduction, desks, space utilization all use occupancy.

One of the ways we do that is wifi triangulation.

Every building has wifi.

And something every meeting room has is a microphone.

We can leverage the mic input to track occupancy.

Expanding the options and possibility of tracking occupancy which in turn creates a richer, more contextualized picture.
