Every other Tuesday night, I have participated in Sydney University’s Genesis start-up program as a mentor and judge for the prize. Genesis startups are at least at the MVP stage, some with early customers. A few start-ups are very relevant to our work in AI. I know many of you would love a demo of their products. I’ll do a few personal introductions, but please let me know if any of the businesses below interest you as a potential partner, customer, or investor.

It’s been inspiring to see how much these startups are achieving at each goal night when we all get together.  
I will put some of that contagious start-up energy back into my own work.
