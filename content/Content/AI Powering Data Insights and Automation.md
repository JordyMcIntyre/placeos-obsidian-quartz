If you had the data for everything, what questions would you ask?

This is the promise of AI and analytics.

Before you get there though, data needs to be normalized and structured.

You can't just add everything into a bucket and let the AI work it out.

On a similar note, I am liking the shift towards less dashboards and more insights.

And eventually, action.

This is what's most interesting for us, data being used as a tool and a trigger to take action on—automatically. Which is where I think AI will be like a superpower.
