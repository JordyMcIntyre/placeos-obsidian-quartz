It used to be the case, when employment went up, so did the demand for office space.

That's no longer true.

Employment is up, occupied office space isn't.

Add to that, 1/3 of all real estate leases up for renewal by 2026.

Now is the time to start thinking about, what else can be done with office buildings?

There's two good examples I can think of:

HSBC are leaving their HQ in London, 47 floors, in 2027. The developers are planning to completely retrofit and repurpose the building for mixed-use.  
The building becomes a hub for people to enjoy, work and socialize.

Paris have transformed parts of the city to cater for the Olympics without having to build giant stadiums or precincts.  
There's a lot we can learn from how creative they've been with retrofitting the city.
